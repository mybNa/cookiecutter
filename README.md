> Flask-Marshmallow includes useful extras for integrating with Flask-SQLAlchemy and marshmallow-sqlalchemy.

> To enable SQLAlchemy integration, make sure that both Flask-SQLAlchemy and marshmallow-sqlalchemy are installed.

> Next, initialize the SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow extensions, in that order.

> Declare your models like normal.

> Generate marshmallow Schemas from your models using ModelSchema.

> You can now use your schema to dump and load your ORM objects.
